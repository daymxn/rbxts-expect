## Assertion.is_array property

Helper property for checking if a value has already passed an  check.

**Signature:**

```typescript
is_array?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

Is set by  passing.

Can be used in other expect methods to skip checking if their actual value is an array, or to toggle certain logic if it is.
