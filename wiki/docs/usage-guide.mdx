# Usage Guide

So you're interested in how to use `@rbxts/expect`?

This page will run you through some of the core concepts of `@rbxts/expect`, and give you an idea on the expected usage.

## Matchers

Matchers are methods that perform checks on your actual value. They're the core functionality of `@rbxts/expect`.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.not.be.empty();
// empty is a matcher
```

Depending on your preference, you can either:

1. Look through the [matchers](category/matchers) category for a compilation of matchers, organized by their effect on
   certain types.
2. Look through the [api](api) reference to see _all_ the available matchers.

Both have similiar documentation, the only difference is that the [matchers](category/matchers) category organizes a lot
of the _common_ matchers by type- where's the [api](api) reference has all the matchers in a single list.

## Proxies

Proxies are effectively just wrappers around values; wrappers that allow `@rbxts/expect` to track the path you access
(for error messages).

```logs
Expected parent.cars to be empty, but it had 2 elements.

parent.cars: '["Tesla","Civic"]'
```

### Creating proxies

To create a proxy, you just need to call the [createProxy](api/expect.createproxy) method before you start your property
chain.

```ts
import { expect, createProxy } from "@rbxts/expect";

const dad = {
  name: "Dad",
  age: 25,
  cars: ["Tesla", "Civic"],
};

const person = {
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 24,
  parent: dad,
};

expect(createProxy(person).parent.cars).to.be.empty();
```

```logs title="Console"
Expected parent.cars to be empty, but it had 2 elements.

parent.cars: '["Tesla","Civic"]'
```

All the provided matchers come with variants of their error message when used alongside proxies.

### Proxy callbacks

If you're wanting to make multiple checks on a single object, you can use the [withProxy](api/expect.withproxy)
function, which will invoke your callback with the created proxy.

```ts
import { expect, withProxy } from "@rbxts/expect";

const dad = {
  name: "Dad",
  age: 25,
  cars: ["Tesla", "Civic"],
};

const person = {
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 24,
  parent: dad,
};

withProxy(person, (proxy) => {
  expect(proxy.age).to.equal(24);
  expect(proxy.parent).to.be.ok();
  expect(proxy.parent.cars).to.be.empty();
});
```

```logs title="Console"
Expected parent.cars to be empty, but it had 2 elements.

parent.cars: '["Tesla","Civic"]'
```

:::warning

Proxies are _ONLY_ intended to be used on the _left_ side of checks (the "actual" value).

Using a proxy on the right side (the "expected" value) is _undefined_ behavior and, depending on the method, may result
in a warning to your console.

:::

## Config

`@rbxts/expect` exports the [ExpectConfig](api/expect.expectconfig) interface as a means for configuring certain
behaviors in your `expect` calls.

```ts
export interface ExpectConfig {
  /**
   * The length at which collapsible values become collapsed variants.
   *
   * @defaultValue `20`
   *
   * @remarks
   * When actual/expected values are beyond this length in size (as strings), they
   * are converted into "collapsed" versions of themselves.
   *
   * Arrays are collapsed to `[...]`
   * Objects are collapsed to `{...}`
   * Strings are collapsed to `"..."`
   * And everything else is collapsed to `'...'`
   *
   * @see {@link ActualPlaceholder.fullValue | fullValue}
   */
  collapseLength: number;
}
```

### Managing the default config

You can use the [setDefaultExpectConfig](api/expect.setdefaultexpectconfig) and
[resetDefaultExpectConfig](api/expect.resetdefaultexpectconfig) functions to update the default config.

```ts
import { expect, withProxy, setDefaultExpectConfig, resetDefaultExpectConfig } from "@rbxts/expect";

export = () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    setDefaultExpectConfig({
      collapseLength: 10,
    });
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    resetDefaultExpectConfig();
  });

  it("checks if the actual value is included in the array", () => {
    expect(5).to.be.anyOf([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).but.not.anyOf([1, 2, 3, 4]);
  });
};
```

Since `expect` uses the latest config whenever it needs a value, you don't need to provide the config anywhere in your
`expect` calls.

## Usage outside of tests

Since `@rbxts/expect` is test-agnostic, you don't need to use it in a testing environment.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { remotes } from "./remotes";
import { saves } from "./saves";
import { pets } from "./data";

remotes.purchasePet.connect(async (player, petId) => {
  const data = saves.get(player);
  const pet = pets.get(petId);

  expect(data.money).to.be.gte(pet.cost);

  data.money -= pet.cost;
  data.pets.push(pet);

  data.save();

  return "Pet purchased!";
});
```

Although, if you want to transform your messages in a different way than what `@rbxts/expect` outputs, it's your job to
catch the exception and rethrow it accordingly.

```ts
try {
  expect(data.money).to.be.gte(pet.cost);
} catch (e) {
  throw "You don't have enough money!";
}
```

## Client usage

Since `@rbxts/expect` doesn't use any server-side services, you can use it on the client without any issues.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { pets } from "@shared/data";
import { LocalData } from "@client/save";
import { remotes } from "@shared/remotes";

export async function buyPet(petId: string) {
  const pet = pets.get(petId);

  expect(LocalData.money).to.be.gte(pet.cost);

  return remotes.purchasePet(petId);
}
```

This way, you can also add a layer of your tech stack that validates state before sending server events; reducing
overhead to your server.

:::warning

While you can utilize `@rbxts/expect` on the client, you should _always_ have checks on the server too.

Rule #1 of Client-Server security: "Never. Trust. The. Client."
