# Module Augmentation

Module augmentation is part of the process of adding your own functionality to `@rbxts/expect`, but it can be a bit
confusing. This guide hopes to give you a better idea of why it's needed, and how it works.

:::info what you'll learn

- What module augmentation is
- How module augmentation fits in `@rbxts/expect`
- How to use module augmentation
- How to define behavior for your augmented modules
- How to use your augented modules in other files
- How to organize your module augmentations to make it easier to maintain

## Overview

[Module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) is a
feature provided by typescript that lets us _extend_ (or augment) existing modules with additional context.

This feature is primarily used to define the structure of existing libraries that were not written in typescript- and as
such, don't have proper types.

In a way, this is similiar to how we [interop with luau](https://roblox-ts.com/docs/guides/using-existing-luau) in
roblox-ts.

:::tip

Another way to look at it is that module augmentation is a way to tell typescript "I know it doesn't _look_ like this
type has this, but _trust me_, it does."

And because we're so smooth, it believes us.

:::

### Defining augmented modules

To define an augmented module, we use the `declare module` syntax, with an identifier that _matches_ our import.

```ts
import { Assertion } from "@rbxts/expect";

// has the same identifer as our import: "@rbxts/expect"
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  // specify the interface we want to augment
  // notice that we also include the generic; this is a requirement of module augmentation
  interface Assertion<T> {
    // provide an outline of the method we want to augment
    equal(other: unknown): this;
  }
}
```

:::warning

Module augmentation does NOT _provide_ the functionality, it only tells typescript that it exists.

We'll learn how to _provide_ the functionality in [extending plugin behavior](#extending-plugin-behavior) below.

:::

### Using augmented modules

Module augmentation is only linked to the file it's defined in. To properly _use_ it in another file, that file needs to
know about the module augmentation.

There are two ways to do this.

## Side effects

Importing a typescript file, without using anything from said file, is called a side-effect import.

```ts title="src/extensions/index.d.ts"
import "@rbxts/expect";

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    customEqual(other: unknown): this;
  }
}
```

```ts tile="src/index.ts"
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";
// highlight-next-line
import "./extensions";

expect(5).to.customEqual(5); // works!
```

This tells typescript to _run_ the code in the imported file, but you don't need anything the file exports.

Since this causes typescript to _run_ the module augmentation, this will allow it to be used in the file that imported
it.

## Definition files

:::warning

Using definition files **only** allows you to define the _type_, it doesn't allow you to
[link the implementation](#extending-plugin-behavior).

As such, it's almost always recommended that you use [side effects](#side-effects) instead.

:::

If you define your module augmentation in a definition file (`.d.ts`), and add this to your `typeRoots` array- you can
make your augmented module globally available.

```ts title="src/types/index.d.ts"
import "@rbxts/expect";

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    customEqual(other: unknown): this;
  }
}
```

```ts title="tsconfig.json"
{
    "typeRoots": ["node_modules/@rbxts", "src/types"]
}
```

```ts tile="src/index.ts"
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.customEqual(5); // works!
```

## Extending plugin behavior

Module augmentation only tells typescript how the function (or property) looks. It doesn't actually provide any behavior
or implementation.

To provide the behavior, the module needs to export some way to add it themselves.

`@rbxts/expect` does this through the [extendMethods](/docs/api/expect.extendmethods.md),
[extendNOPs](/docs/api/expect.extendnops.md), and [extendNegations](/docs/api/expect.extendnegations.md) functions.

```ts
import { CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods } from "@rbxts/expect";

// implement our actual method
const substringImpl: CustomMethodImpl<string> = (_, actual, str: string) => {
  // ...
};

// tell typescript about our method
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    substring(str: string): Assertion<T>;
  }
}

// link our method at runtime
// highlight-start
extendMethods({
  substring: substringImpl,
});
// highlight-end
```

Behind the scenes, `@rbxts/expect` keeps a _global_ object of all the calls to
[extendMethods](/docs/api/expect.extendmethods.md)- with properties mapping to the provided methods (eg;
`"substring" -> substringImpl`).

Then, whenever someone calls [expect](/docs/api/expect.expect.md), all those methods get manually added to the returned
object.

## Organizing augmentations

Importing your module augmentations in each file can be clumbersome, and is a bit too verbose for most people.

Thankfully, module augmentation also applies _downstream_; meaning you can create a centrialized place to run your
side-effects (higher in the import chain).

### Root index

The easiest way to do this is to import your extensions in your root `index.ts` file.

```ts tile="src/index.ts"
import "./extensions";
```

```ts title="src/extensions/index.ts"
// import all the extensions
import "./custom-equal";
import "./extra-negations";
import "./is-player-check";
```

This way, your modules are augmented at the root of your file- and all of the side effects run properly before any other
code.

### Test setup

If you have a setup process in your tests, or a collection of test/mock objects, then you can augment your modules in
the same place.

```ts title="src/server/index.spec.ts"
/// <reference types="@rbxts/testez/globals" />

import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { pet as TestPet } from "@server/util/tests";

import { makePet } from "./actions";

export = () => {
  describe("makePet", () => {
    it("works correctly", () => {
      const pet = makePet(TestPet.id);

      expect(pet).to.deepEqual(TestPet);
    });
  });
};
```

```ts title="src/server/util/tests.ts"
import "@server/extensions";

export const pet = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Cat",
  attack: 5,
  health: 100,
  speed: 30,
};
```

```ts title="src/server/extensions/index.ts"
// import all the extensions
import "./custom-equal";
import "./extra-negations";
import "./is-player-check";
```

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about module augmentation:

- They provide a way to **define** functionality for _other_ modules
- They have to be added to [expect](/docs/api/expect.expect.md) through one of the **extend** methods
- They have to be **linked** at runtime by _importing_ the file
