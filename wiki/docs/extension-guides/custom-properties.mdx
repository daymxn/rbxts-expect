# Custom Properties

Custom properties (or _extension properties_) are properties added to `expect` that _you_ define. They allow you to
_extend_ the existing functionality of `@rbxts/expect` for your own needs.

:::info what you'll learn

- What custom properties are
- The different kinds of custom properies
- How to implement your own custom properties
- Guidance on proper usage

## Overview

Custom properties can fall under three different categories:

- Negations
- NOPs
- Metadata

### Negations

Negation properties are properties that "negate" or "flip" the result of subsquent methods.

For example:

```ts
expect(5).to.not.equal(4);
```

In this case, `not` is the negation.

Instead of checking if `5 === 5`, we are now checking if `5 !== 5`.

:::tip

Negations flip one another!

```ts
expect(5).to.never.not.equal(4); // passes!
```

:::

#### Adding your own

To add your own negation property, you can use the `extendNegations` method.

```ts
import { extendNegations } from "@rbxts/expect";

// tell typescript about our properties
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    readonly not: this;
    readonly never: this;
  }
}

// link our negations at runtime
extendNegations(["not", "never"]);
```

`expect` will automatically handle the linkage of these properties, and ensure they return the `this` instance
automatically- while also internally flipping the "negation" switch.

### NOPs

NOP properties are properties that effectively do nothing. Their only purpose is to make the test easier to read.

For example:

```ts
expect("Daymon").to.have.the.substring("Day");
```

In this case, `to`, `have`, and `the` are all NOPs; they have no effect on the outcome of the test.

#### Adding your own

To add your own negation property, you can use the `extendNOPs` method.

```ts
import { extendNOPs } from "@rbxts/expect";

// tell typescript about our properties
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    readonly and: this;
    readonly be: this;
  }
}

// link our NOPs at runtime
extendNOPs(["and", "be"]);
```

`expect` will automatically handle the linkage of these properties, and ensure they return the `this` instance
automatically.

### Metadata

Metadata properties are properties that are only present as the result of a previous check.

For example, the `array` method attaches the `is_array` property whenever it passes:

```ts
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, CustomMethodImpl, place } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} be an array`);

const array: CustomMethodImpl<unknown> = (source, actual) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use();

  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  source.is_array = true;
  return message.pass();
};

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    // highlight-next-line
    is_array?: boolean;
    array(): Assertion<T extends unknown[] ? T : T[]>;
  }
}
```

#### Adding your own

Since these properties don't need any special handling by `expect`, you don't need to call any extension methods.

So long as you augment the module with your property (and populate it in your method), you can use it without issue.

the custom methods guide.

## Best practices

- **Avoid overwriting methods and properties**: Whether it works or doesn't work, it's not intended for you to be able
  to overwrite methods with different kinds of properties and vise versa. That is, you shouldn't overwrite the `a`
  property with a custom `a` method.
- **Ensure your metadata is nullable**: Since metadata isn't populated by default, ensure the type you define in your
  module augmentation is nullable- to avoid accidentally assuming it's present in usages.
- **Keep chain properties short**: NOPs and negations are intended to be quick ways to either chain the message, or flip
  a check. They should be short to justify their usage.
- **Flow like a sentence**: The ideal `expect` chain is one that reads like a sentence. I "expect 5 to be equal to 5" or
  I "expect 'daymon' to be a string with a size of 6". Your NOPs and negations should follow this pattern, so that they
  align with the other design decisions made by `@rbxts/expect`.

## Examples

To see some practical examples of extension properties, you can check out the
[main repo](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect) for `@rbxts/expect`.

More specifically, you can take a look at the
[negations folder](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/tree/main/src/expect/extensions/negations) and the
[noops folder](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/tree/main/src/expect/extensions/noops).

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about custom properties:

- They provide a way to add your **own** properties to `@rbxts/expect`
- **NOPS** are properties that _do nothing_
- **Negations** are properties that _invert_ checks
- **Metadata** are properties that define _state_ for _other_ checks to use
- They get added to `@rbxts/expect` through the [extendNOPs](/docs/api/expect.extendnops.md) and
  [extendNegations](/docs/api/expect.extendnegations.md) functions
- They get added to **typescript** through [module augmentation](module-augmentation)
