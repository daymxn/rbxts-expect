# Testing

Tests are an important part of every technological stack, even plugin based ones. This guide will help you setup and
organize your tests for your custom methods- to ensure they're working as expected.

## Overview

To setup an environment to test in, you need to ensure your extension is included as a part of your build process.

For futher guidance on how to include your extension in your build process, see the
[using extensions](introduction#using-extensions) section of the introduction page.

### Organizing tests

Tests for custom methods can be split into two categories:

- Tests to ensure your method works as expected
- Tests for the error messages your method outputs

#### Functionality

Functionality tests are those that test that your method passes or fails as you expect it to.

You typically want to split these up into sub-sections (depending on how your framework functions), accordingly to
logical paths in your method.

For example, the [empty](/docs/api/expect.assertion.empty.md) method works for strings, arrays, and objects. So we split
the tests up for each logical path.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { TEST_SON } from "@src/util/setup-tests";

export = () => {
  describe("empty", () => {
    it("checks if arrays have any elements", () => {
      expect([]).to.be.empty();
      expect([1]).to.not.be.empty();
    });

    it("checks if strings have any characters", () => {
      expect("").to.be.empty();
      expect("Daymon").to.not.be.empty();
    });

    it("checks if objects have any keys", () => {
      expect({}).to.be.empty();
      expect(TEST_SON).to.not.be.empty();
    });
  });
};
```

If your method takes an `expected` value, you can also take advantage of method chaining.

```ts
export = () => {
  describe("equal", () => {
    it("compares the values strictly", () => {
      expect(5).to.equal(5).but.not.equal("5");
      expect("Daymon").to.equal("Daymon").but.not.equal("daymon");
    });
  });
```

#### Messages

It's also important to test that your method throws the messages you expect it to, whenever things fail.

We provide the `err` method to help make this process easier.

```ts
import { expect, err } from "@rbxts/expect";
import "@src/util/setup-tests";

export = () => {
  describe("equal", () => {
    // ...
  });

  describe("error message", () => {
    it("throws if the values are not equal", () => {
      err(() => {
        expect(5).to.equal("5");
      }, `Expected '5' (number) to strictly equal "5" (string)`);
    });
  });
};
```

`err` will make sure that the function throws with a message that contains the substring you specify.

You can specify multiple substrings, and `err` will make sure that they _all_ are present in the output.

This comes in handy when testing for metadata, but you don't want to make strong assertions about newlines and indent
formats.

```ts
it("works with paths", () => {
  err(
    () => {
      withProxy(TEST_SON, (proxy) => {
        expect(proxy.parent?.age).to.equal("5");
      });
    },
    'Expected parent.age to strictly equal "5" (string)',
    "parent.age: '5' (number)",
  );
});
```

:::tip

It's **strongly** recommended that you have a test case for [proxies](/docs/usage-guide#proxies), as this can often be
seen as a different environment for test messages to be in.

## Examples

To see real-world examples of what tests look like, take a look at the tests we use for the pre-packaged methods on the
[main repo](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adaymxn%2Frbxts-expect+path%3A*.spec.ts&type=code).

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about testing:

- They should test that your method **works** as it's intended to
- They should test that the errors your method outputs **look** as they're intended to
- You can use the [err](/docs/api/expect.err.md) method to test your **errors**
- They should have cases for testing **proxies** to ensure your method works in all cases
