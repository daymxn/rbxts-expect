# Custom Methods

Custom methods (or _extension methods_) are methods added to `expect` that _you_ provide the implementation for. They
allow you to _extend_ the existing functionality of `@rbxts/expect` for your own needs.

## Overview

A custom method is an implementor of the `CustomMethodImpl` type:

```ts
export type CustomMethodImpl<T = unknown> = (source: Assertion<T>, actual: T, ...args: never[]) => ExpectMethodResult;
```

### Source

The `source` parameter of a custom method is just a mapping to the parent `Assertion` that created the call. The
`Assertion` interface is the closest thing to an "instance" of the `expect` function; it carries all the methods that
you call after `expect`, and optionally some [metadata](#Metadata) for custom methods to use.

You'll rarely need to use it, but it comes in handy when dealing with [metadata](#Metadata).

```ts
import { CustomMethodImpl } from "@src/expect/extend";

function validateArrayIsEmpty(actual: defined[]) {
  // ...
}

function validateObjectIsEmpty(actual: object) {
  // ...
}

const empty: CustomMethodImpl<unknown> = (source, actual) => {
  if (typeIs(actual, "table")) {
    if (source.is_array) return validateArrayIsEmpty(actual);
    return validateObjectIsEmpty(actual);
  }
  // ...
};
```

### Actual

The `source` parameter of a custom method maps to what we call the "actual" value. This is the value that was passed
into the initial `expect` call. This is in contrast to the "expected" value.

For example:

```ts
expect(5).to.equal(6);
```

In this case, `5` is the "actual" value and `6` is the "expected" value. We _expected_ the value `6`, but we _actually_
got the value `5`.

You can see an example of its usage in the `equal` method:

```ts
import { CustomMethodImpl, ExpectMessageBuilder, place } from "@src/expect/extend";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} strictly equal ${place.expected.value} (${place.expected.type})`,
);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

### Additional arguments

The `...args` parameter in a custom method is just a variable amount of additional arguments you can pass. Usually, this
only really includes one; the "expected" argument.

For example:

```ts
expect(5).to.equal(6);
```

In this case, there's only one extra argument, and it's for the "expected" value.

Sometimes, you need more than one extra argument though. The [enum](/docs/api/expect.assertion.enum) method is a perfect
example of this:

```ts
import type { EnumValue, LuaEnum, CustomMethodImpl } from "@rbxts/expect";

function validateIsEnumType(actual: keyof LuaEnum, enumType: LuaEnum) {
  // ...
}

function validateIsEnumValue(actual: keyof LuaEnum, enumType: LuaEnum, value: keyof LuaEnum) {
  // ...
}

const _enum: CustomMethodImpl<keyof LuaEnum> = (source, actual, enumType: LuaEnum, value?: keyof LuaEnum) => {
  if (value !== undefined) {
    return validateIsEnumValue(actual, enumType, value).inspect(() => {
      source.enum_type = enumType;
    });
  } else {
    return validateIsEnumType(actual, enumType).inspect(() => {
      source.enum_type = enumType;
    });
  }
};
```

Here, we have _two_ extra arguments; one that maps to the `LuaEnum` and another (optionally) for a value of that enum.

This allows us to provide two different methods:

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

enum Sport {
  Basketball,
  Soccer,
  Football,
}

// validate "actual" is of enum type 'Sport'
expect("Basketball").to.be.enum(Sport);

// validate "actual" of of enum type 'Sport' and of value `Sport.Basketball`
expect("Basketball").to.be.enum(Sport, Sport.Basketball);
```

### ExpectMethodResult

The return value of custom methods is of the type `ExpectMethodResult`.

```ts
export type ExpectMethodResult = Result<ExpectMessageBuilder, ExpectMessageBuilder>;
```

The `Result` type comes from the `@rbxts/rust-classes` package, but we provide wrappers around it (which we'll get into
in a moment)- so there's no need to look much into that.

The key thing to focus on here is the `ExpectMessageBuilder`.

You'll learn more about `ExpectMessageBuilder` in the [expect messages](expect-messages) guide, but it's essentially
just a wrapper around the error messages your check throws.

```ts
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, CustomMethodImpl, place } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} strictly equal ${place.expected.value} (${place.expected.type})`,
);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

You create instances of these builders through the `use` method, populate them with various utility methods provided on
the [ExpectMessageBuilder](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.md) class (such as
[expectedValue](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.expectedvalue.md)), and then return them through either the
[pass](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.pass.md) or [fail](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.fail.md) methods.

:::info

The [pass](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.pass.md) and [fail](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.fail.md)
methods are the "wrappers" around the `Result` type we talked about above.

Returning these types allows `expect` to throw the right message (either a negated pass, or a failure), without the
method needing to know what's going on state-wise. This helps keep your methods simple and deterministic.

:::

## Metadata

Metadata is additional data attached to `expect` chains, that is derrived from the result of a previous method call.

For example, the `array` method attaches the `is_array` property, whenever it passes.

```ts
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, CustomMethodImpl, place } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} be an array`);

const array: CustomMethodImpl<unknown> = (source, actual) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use();

  // ...

  // highlight-next-line
  source.is_array = true;
  return message.pass();
};

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    // highlight-next-line
    is_array?: boolean;
    array(): Assertion<T extends unknown[] ? T : T[]>;
  }
}
```

This allows other methods to take advantage of this property to skip certain checks, or change their output accordingly.

For example, the `empty` method supports strings, arrays, and tables. But not only does it need different logic for
tables and strings- but it has a different message for arrays and tables:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="arrays" default>

```ts
expect([1]).to.be.empty();
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '[1]' to be empty, but it had an element
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tables">

```ts
expect({ name: "Daymon" }).to.be.empty();
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected the object to be empty, but it had the key 'name'
Value of [name]: "Daymon"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To help accomplish this, the `empty` method checks the `is_array` property:

```ts
if (typeIs(actual, "table")) {
  if (source.is_array) {
    return validateArrayIsEmpty(actual as defined[]);
  } else {
    return validateObjectIsEmpty(actual);
  }
}
```

Which would translate like so:

```ts
expect([1, 2, 3]).to.be.an.array().that.is.empty();
```

## Usage

Once you've got a custom method implemented, you can add it to `@rbxts/expect` through the
[extendMethods](/docs/api/expect.extendmethods.md).

```ts
import { CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods, ExpectMessageBuilder, place } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { includes } from "@rbxts/string-utils";

// define a message for when our check fails
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} have the substring ${place.expected.value}`,
);

// implement our actual method
const substring: CustomMethodImpl<string> = (_, actual, str: string) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(str);

  return includes(actual, str) ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};

// tell typescript about our method
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    substring(str: string): Assertion<T>;
  }
}

// link our method at runtime
extendMethods({
  substring: substring,
});
```

## Best practices

- **Validate casted types**: If your `CustomMethodImpl` specifies types other than `unknown`- you should have
  validations at the start of your method to ensure they're the expected type.
- **Split overloads into seperate functions**: If your extension method provides an overload, or optional argument,
  don't be afraid to split your implementation into multiple functions to properly encompass this. You can look at the
  implementation for the [enum](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/blob/main/src/expect/extensions/enum/index.ts)
  method to see an example of this.

## Examples

All of the matchers that are bundled with `@rbxts/expect` are also implemented in this same way.

So if you want to see some example implementations, take a look at the
[extensions](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/tree/main/src/expect/extensions) directory on the main repo.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about custom methods:

- They provide a way to add your **own** checks to `@rbxts/expect`
- They return instances of `ExpectMessageBuilder` through the **pass** and **fail** methods
- They can add **metadata** to `Assertion` for `expect` chains
- They get added to `@rbxts/expect` through the [extendMethods](/docs/api/expect.extendmethods.md) function
- They get added to **typescript** through [module augmentation](module-augmentation)
