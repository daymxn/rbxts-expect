# Publishing

You can publish your extension libraries for either yourself to use in other projects, or for others to take advantage
of your hard work.

## Overview

So you're ready to publish your extension library.

Before you do-so, there's a few things unique to extension libraries that you need to be aware of.

### Peer dependency

When you call [extendMethods](/docs/api/expect.extendmethods.md), you are adding your method to a global record of
methods. This record gets used whenever someone calls [expect](/docs/api/expect.expect.md).

The problem, is that `npm` will create a _different_ instance of `@rbxts/expect` for the consumer and the user. This is
done to avoid dependency conflicts, but it also means you can't share state between your library and the consumer's
`@rbxts/expect`.

To avoid this, your library should _not_ have a direct dependency on `@rbxts/expect`. Instead, it should have use the
`devDependency` scope, and expose `@rbxts/expect` under the `peerDependencies` scope.

```json
// don't do this!
// error-next-line
"dependencies": {
  "@rbxts/expect": "^1.0.1"
}
```

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@rbxts/expect": "^1.0.1"
},
"peerDependencies": {
  "@rbxts/expect": "^1.0.0"
}
```

The `@rbxts/expect` under `devDependencies` specifies the version that your library actually _uses_.

The `@rbxts/expect` under `peerDependencies` specifies the version that your library _expects_ consumers to have. You
generally want this to be the same major version as what you built with, without regard for the minor or patch version;
this way, you don't need to worry about updating your library everytime a new minor or patch version of `@rbxts/expect`
comes out.

### Flattening exports

Depending on how you intend your library to be consumed, you may need to flatten your exports.

For example, lets say we had the following folder stucture:

```text
src/
  index.ts
  extensions/
    none/
      index.ts
    some/
      index.ts
```

As it stands, for consumers to properly _use_ our extensions, they would need to have imports like so:

```ts
import "@rbxts/expect-myextensions/extensions/none";
import "@rbxts/expect-myextensions/extensions/some";
```

This is generally undesirable, and considered overtly verbose. To avoid this, we can flatten our exports.

```text title="file structure"
src/
  index.ts
  extensions/
    // highlight-next-line
    index.ts
    none/
      index.ts
    some/
      index.ts
```

```ts title="src/extensions/index.ts"
import "./none";
import "./some";
```

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import "./extensions";
```

Then, our consumer can import all our extensions at once.

```ts
import "@rbxts/expect-myextensions";
```

#### When you shouldn't flatten

If your library uses multiple entry points for collision purposes, flattening your exports may be undesirable.

For example, let's say we had an extension library that published different types for promises.

```text title="file structure"
src/
  index.ts
  extensions/
    equal/
      index.ts
  promise-extensions/
    equal/
      index.ts
```

```ts title="src/extensions/equal/index.ts"
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, place, CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    equal<R = T>(expectedValue: R): Assertion<R>;
  }
}

extendMethods({
  equal: equal,
});
```

```ts title="src/promise-extensions/equal/index.ts"
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, place, CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<Promise<defined>> = (_, actual, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual.expect() === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    equal<R = T>(expectedValue: R): Assertion<R>;
  }
}

extendMethods({
  equal: equal,
});
```

If we tried flattening these exports, either the bundler would create collision suffixes (eg; `equal` and `equal$1`), or
we would get an error.

To avoid this, we may want consumers to import these directories directly.

```ts
import "@rbxts/expect-myextensions/extensions";

// or for promises
import "@rbxts/expect-myextensions/promise-extensions";
```

In this case, just flatten your exports up to the directory level, but _not_ at the root `index.ts` level.

### Namespace

If you want to publish your own extension library for others to use, you should do so with the format
`@rbxts/expect-{EXTENSION_NAME}`, so your library can be easily found by
[searching npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40rbxts%2Fexpect) for `@rbxts/expect` extension libraries.

You don't _have_ to do this, but it helps make your extension library more discoverable.

### API extractor

If youre using [api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) to document your API, then your augmented modules will _not_
be picked up during the rollup phase. This is due to an
[open bug with api-extractor](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues/1709).

#### Fixes

There's a couple ways to fix this, but they come with their own issues.

##### External rollup

You can use [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) for the rollup, and then feed the generated `.d.ts` file into
`api-extractor`. But this solution comes with its own problems, and you lose source linkage for api warnings.

##### Exporting functions

You can export your methods alongside the augmented ones- and provide documentation on those.

```ts
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, place, CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`);

/**
 * Asserts that the value is _shallow_ equal to the `expectedValue`.
 */
export const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    /**
     * Asserts that the value is _shallow_ equal to the `expectedValue`.
     */
    equal<R = T>(expectedValue: R): Assertion<R>;
  }
}

extendMethods({
  equal: equal,
});
```

But this is verbose, and doesn't necessarily come out as you may hope for method types.

#### Future work

It doesn't seem like the bug with `api-extractor` will be fixed any-time soon.

Ideally, I'd like to personally contribute a fix for this to the `api-extractor` repo, but I don't currently have the
time to do so.

For now, `@rbxts/expect` is using a combination of the [external rollup](#external-rollup) and some
[post processing](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/tree/main/scripts/src/transformers) scripts to circumvent this
issue. But long-term, this will need to be fixed at the root.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about publishing:

- Your library needs to expose a **peer dependency** on `@rbxts/expect`
- Your library should _NOT_ have a direct dependency on `@rbxts/expect`, but should have a **dev dependency** instead
- Your exports make need to be **flattened** if you want consumers to only have to import a single file
- To ensure your library is **discoverable**, it should be published under the namespace
  `@rbxts/expect-{EXTENSION_NAME}`
