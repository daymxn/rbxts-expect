# Expect Messages

Expect messages are the error messages that [custom methods](custom-methods) throw whenever they fail.

`@rbxts/expect` provides various utility methods to make creating these messages easier, and to help you practice
property [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principles.

:::info what you'll learn

- What expect messages are
- The different components of an expect message
- How to implement your own expect message
- Guidance on proper usage

:::

## Overview

[ExpectMessageBuilder](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.md) is how we define the _structure_ of an error message.

We then "populate" this message through methods on [ExpectMessageBuilder](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.md),
when in our [custom method](custom-methods).

At the end of our methods, we _return_ this populated instance, and `@rbxts/expect` will handle throwing the actual
error.

### Creation

To create an [ExpectMessageBuilder](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.md), you just call the
[default constructor](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder._constructor_.md).

```ts
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, place } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} to equal ${place.expected.value}`,
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} to NOT equal ${place.expected.value}`,
);
```

The first argument is the message that will be used when your check fails:

```ts
expect(1).to.equal(2);
```

The second argument is the message that will be used when your check passes, but it was negated:

```ts
expect(1).to.not.equal(2);
```

### Placeholders

You might've noticed these in the previous examples, but placeholders (prefixed with the `place` keyword) are basically
just drop-in replacements for a variety of data that will be automatically populated before your message is thrown.

```ts
export interface ActualPlaceholder {
  fullValue: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
}
export interface ExpectedPlaceholder {
  fullValue: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
}
export interface Placeholder {
  actual: ActualPlaceholder;
  expected: ExpectedPlaceholder;
  index: string;
  name: string;
  nil: string;
  not: string;
  path: string;
  reason: string;
  undefined: string;
}
export const place: Placeholder;
```

You'll learn more about each placeholder, and their usage, in the following sections.

### Usage

To _use_ a message, you call the [use](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.use.md) method; this will return a copy of
the message. With this copy, you can then call various methods on the message to populate data- and use the
[pass](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.pass.md)/[fail](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.fail.md) methods to
return it.

```ts
import { CustomMethodImpl, ExpectMessageBuilder, place } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} strictly equal ${place.expected.value}`,
);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

:::warning

Not calling [use](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.use.md) may cause your variables to leak into other (unrelated)
messages. It's important to call `use` before adding data.

The _only_ reason you can populate data before calling `use` is because this allows you to populate "default" data.

You'll learn more about what this looks like in the [metadata](#metadata) section.

:::

## Variable data

[VariableData](/docs/api/expect.variabledata.md) is the type used behind the scenes for the "actual" and "expected"
variables.

```ts
export interface VariableData {
  value: unknown;
  type?: string;
}
```

These correspond to the [ActualPlaceholder](/docs/api/expect.actualplaceholder.md) and
[ExpectedPlaceholder](/docs/api/expect.expectedplaceholder.md) types as well.

```ts
export interface ActualPlaceholder {
  fullValue: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
}
export interface ExpectedPlaceholder {
  fullValue: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
}
```

### Usage

For example, lets say we were checking if two values are equal.

```ts
import { ExpectMessageBuilder, place, CustomMethodImpl } from "@rbxts/expect";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} (${place.actual.type}) to equal ${place.expected.value} (${place.expected.type})`,
);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage
    .use()
    .actualValue(actual)
    .actualType(typeOf(actual))
    .expectedValue(expected)
    .expectedType(typeOf(expected));

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '5' (number) to equal "5" (string)
```

Using the helper methods on `ExpectMessageBuilder`, we "populated" the data for the actual and expected variables in our
final message.

Alternatively, you can use the `actual` and `expected` methods to populate the value and type at the same time.

```ts
const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage
    .use()
    .actual({
      value: actual,
      type: typeOf(actual),
    })
    .expected({
      value: expected,
      type: typeOf(expected),
    });

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

### Automatic behavior

`expect` automatically populates some data for you, so some of this can actually be removed entirely.

#### Type

By default, the `type` property is automatically computed according to the `value`. So if you're calling `typeOf`, you
don't have to manually populate this.

```ts
const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().actualValue(actual).expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

##### So why have it

There are certain situations where the inferred type from `typeOf` may not be desired.

For example, what if we wanted to support a custom class type?

```ts
const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  if (isMyCustomType(expected)) {
    message.expectedType("MyCustomType");
    // logic unique to MyCustomType ...
  }
  // ...
};
```

#### Actual

By default, the data for `actual` is automatically computed and populated for you. So if you're not mutating it, or
adding additional context- there's no need to do it manually.

```ts
const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

##### So why have it

While the `actual` variable is set automatically, sometimes your method has additional context- or a better way to
represent the value.

A prime example of this is the [enum](/docs/api/expect.assertion.enum) method.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.actual.value} to equal ${place.expected.value}`);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, enumTable, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);
  const valueAsEnum = enumTable[actual];
  message.actualValue(valueAsEnum);
  // ...
};
```

So instead of this output:

```logs
Expected '0' to equal "Basketball"
```

We can get this output:

```logs
Expected "Soccer" to equal "Basketball"
```

### Full Value

You might have noticed that there's a property on the placeholder types called `fullValue` that isn't present on the
`VariableData` types.

```ts
export interface ActualPlaceholder {
  // highlight-next-line
  fullValue: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
}
export interface ExpectedPlaceholder {
  // highlight-next-line
  fullValue: string;
  type: string;
  value: string;
}
```

By default, the `value` property is what we call the "collapsed" version of the value.

This means that it respects the [collapseLength](/docs/api/expect.expectconfig.collapselength.md) as defined in the
config.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} to be empty\nFullValue: ${place.actual.fullValue}`,
);
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '[...]' to be empty
FullValue: '[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]'
```

You can use the `fullValue` property to ignore the `collapseLength` and attach the full version of the value.

This allows you to keep the first sentence of your check _short_ and _easy to read_, while also providing enough data
_after_ the first message- to debug the issue.

## Keywords

Some of the placeholders are either drop-ins for certain words, or are only present given a certain context.

### Not

The `not` placeholder is a drop-in for the word `"NOT"`, but is _only_ present if your message is negated.

This can come in handy when the only difference between your failure message and your negated message is the word "NOT".

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.actual.value} to ${place.not} be empty`);

// is the same as
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} to be empty`,
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} to NOT be empty`,
);
```

:::tip

By default, if you don't provide a negated message as the second argument of your `ExpectMessageBuilder` constructor
call, it defaults to the first argument (your standard failure message).

This allows you to take full advantage of the `not` keyword.

:::

### Nil

The `nil` and `undefined` placeholders are drop-ins for the word `"nil"`.

For example, let's say we were checking if an object was an arry:

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.actual.value} to be an array`);
```

In our method, we could do something like this:

```ts
message.actualValue(actualValue ?? place.nil);
```

Then, (if `actual` was undefined) our output would come out like so:

```logs
Expected 'nil' to be an array
```

:::tip

Behind the scenes, `expect` automatically does this for the `actual` and `expected` values.

The placeholders are provided anyways to allow you to do something similiar for nested values, or values beyond `actual`
and `expected`.

:::

## Path

The `path` placeholder maps to the path on nested variables.

When working with tables, you might want to retain the path to the property that failed.

Using a `path`, you can specify a place in your message for this data to be provided.

While you can call the [path method](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.path.md) to manually provide this data,
[proxies](/docs/usage-guide#proxies) will automatically provide this for you.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`${place.path} - Expected ${place.actual.value} to be an array`);
```

```logstitle="Console"
parent.cars - Expected '2' to be an array
```

## Name

The `name` placeholder maps to either the [path](#path) or the value of the `actual`.

A common theme in messages in to display the path when working with tables, and display the actual value when working
with non tables.

Using a `name`, you can specify to use the `path` whenever it's available, but fallback to the `actual` value.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to be an array`);
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="tables" default>

```ts
withProxy(person, (p) => {
  expect(p.cars).to.be.an.array();
});
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected parent.cars to be an array
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="others">

```ts
expect(5).to.be.an.array();
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '5' to be an array
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom names

The default `name` is the value of the `actual` variable. But you can override this default via the `name` method.

For example, maybe you wanna attach the type alongside the value.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to be an array`).name(`${place.actual.value} (${place.actual.type})`);
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '5' (number) to be an array
```

## Metadata

Metadata is additional data that follows after the main message, in the format of `key: value`.

Lets say we're checking that all the values in an array are equal to an `expected` value.

```ts
for (const [index, value] of ipairs(actual)) {
  message.metadata({ Index: index, Value: value });
  if (value !== expected) return message.fail();
}
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '[1,1,2]' to all be equal to '1', but there was a value that was not.

Index: 3
Value: 2
```

Metadata is useful for data that is only known at runtime, or data that is only needed for additional debugging- and
should be seperate from the main contents of the message.

:::tip

Metadata is sorted alphabetically in the output, but priority is placed for the following keys (in order): 'index',
'key', 'value', 'expected', 'actual'.

So if any of those keys are in your metadata, they'll come before the rest of your metadata. The capitalization doesn't
matter either, so long as the keys are _exactly_ equal.

:::

### Kind of metadata

Beyond the base `metadata`, there are additional kinds of metadata that only get attached under certain circumstances.

#### Failure metadata

Failure metadata is metadata that is _only_ attached to the message if your check fails.

A failure is effectively the same thing as `!negated`. Useful for when you wanna conditionally attach data, but only
when the case is not a negation.

Lets say we're checking that all the values in an array are equal to an `expected` value.

```ts
for (const [index, value] of ipairs(actual)) {
  message.failureMetadata({ Index: index, Value: value });
  if (value !== expected) return message.fail();
}
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '[1,1,2]' to all be equal to '1', but there was a value that was not.

Index: 3
Value: 2
```

This might look the same as using a normal `metadata`, but the difference comes into play when the result is a pass.

If we used normal `metadata`, and our check was passed- but it was negated:

```ts
expect([1, 1, 1]).to.not.allEqual(1);
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '[1,1,1]' to NOT all be equal to '1'.

Index: 3
Value: 1
```

But if we use `failureMetadata` instead, it won't be attached in the case of a pass:

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '[1,1,1]' to NOT all be equal to '1'.
```

:::tip

Failure metadata will come _after_ any attached (base) `metadata`, if there's any present.

:::

#### Nested metadata

Nested metadata is metadata that is _only_ attached to the message if there's a [path](#path) present.

Useful for when you wanna conditionally attach data, but only when the case is on nested objects.

A very common use-case is attaching data about the actual value for nested objects when using a [name](#name), so you
still get the path to the variable in the initial message.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value} (${place.expected.type})`,
)
  .name(`${place.actual.value} (${place.actual.type})`)
  .nestedMetadata({
    [place.path]: `${place.actual.value} (${place.actual.type})`,
  });
```

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="with a path" default>

```logstitle="Console"
Expected parent.age to equal "5" (string)

parent.age: '5' (number)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="without a path">

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '5' (number) to equal "5" (string)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip

Nested metadata will come _before_ **all** other metadata types (including the "base" `metadata`), if there's any
present.

:::

#### Surface metadata

Surface metadata is metadata that is _only_ attached to the message if there's NOT a [path](#path) present.

Effectively the opposite of [nested metadata](#nested-metadata).

Useful for when you wanna conditionally attach data, but only when the case is on non nested objects.

For example, let's say we were checking if an object was empty, and we wanted to use the name `the object` to keep the
message short:

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} be empty`)
  .name("the object")
  .nestedMetadata({ [place.path]: place.actual.value });
```

We might have logic like so:

```ts
if (amount > 1) {
  return message.suffix(`, but it had ${amount} keys`).surfaceMetadata({ Value: place.actual.value }).fail();
}
```

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="with a path" default>

```logstitle="Console"
Expected parent.parent to be empty, but it had 2 keys

parent.parent: '{"name":"Daymon","age":24}'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="without a path">

```logstitle="Console"
Expected the object to be empty, but it had 2 keys

Value: '{"name":"Daymon","age":24}'
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip

Surface metadata (like nested metadata) will come _before_ **all** other metadata types (including the "base"
`metadata`), if there's any present.

:::

## Reason

The `reason` placeholder is a a utility placeholder for describing why the check failed.

A lot of times, your check might me making multiple assertions, or have different errors depending on the context.

Using a `reason`, you can specify a place in your message for this data to be provided.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}, but ${place.reason}`,
);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  if (typeOf(actual) !== typeOf(expected)) {
    return message.reason("it was a different type").fail();
  }

  if (actual !== value) {
    return message.reason("it had a different value").fail();
  }

  // apply a default reason for negations
  return message.reason("it did").pass();
};
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected "4" to equal '4', but it was a different type
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '10' to equal '10', but it was a different type
```

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '10' to NOT equal '10', but it did
```

:::tip

You can use the helper method `failWithReason` to provide a `reason` and return a `fail` at the same time.

```ts
return message.failWithReason("it was a different type");

// is the same as
return message.reason("it was a different type").fail();
```

:::

### Automatic attachment

If you don't have a place in your message for `reason` to be populated, but still call "provide" a reason via the
[reason](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.reason.md) method, then the message builder will automatically attach a
`Reason: ${place.reason}` after your message.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(expected);

  if (typeOf(actual) !== typeOf(expected)) {
    return message.reason("it was a different type").fail();
  }

  if (actual !== value) {
    return message.reason("it had a different value").fail();
  }

  return message.pass();
};
```

```logs
Expected "4" to equal '4'
Reason: it was a different type
```

This way, you can add a `reason` whenever you need it, without needing to find a predefined spot for it in your message.

:::info

If your message has any [metadata](#metadata) attach to it, the `Reason: message` line will come before it.

:::

## Prefix types

The base message is typically referred to as the "prefix" of your message, in contrast to all the data that follows.

But there are a few different types of prefixes your message can have.

### Failure prefix

Otherwise known as the "base" prefix. This is the prefix attached to your messages whenever your check fails.

You can specify this prefix when creating your `ExpectMessageBuilder` instance.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}`);
```

You can also also _append_ this prefix with the `appendPrefix` method.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}`).appendPrefix(", but it was not");

// Would be the same as
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value},
but it was not`,
);
```

Or when you call `use`, you can provide an additional message to append as well.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}`);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use(", but it was not").expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

### Negated prefix

The negated prefix is a prefix that _replaces_ the failure prefix, but _only_ when your message is negated.

You can specify this prefix (as the second argument) when creating your `ExpectMessageBuilder` instance.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}`,
  `Expected ${place.name} to NOT equal ${place.expected.value}`,
);
```

Calling `appendPrefix` and `use` will _also_ append to the negation prefix.

:::tip

By default, the negation prefix is set to be the same as the failure prefix.

This allows you to do things like this:

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`);
```

:::

### Trailing failure prefix

The trailing failure prefix is a prefix that is attached to the end of your prefix, but _only_ if the check fails.

Another way to look at it is that it's a prefix attached to the end of your [failure prefix](#failure-prefix), but NOT
your [negated prefix](#negated-prefix).

You can specify a trailing failure prefix with the `trailingFailurePrefix` method.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`).trailingFailurePrefix(
  ", but it was not",
);

// Would be the same as
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}, but it was not`,
  `Expected ${place.name} to NOT equal ${place.expected.value}`,
);
```

Alternatively, you can specify a trailing failure prefix as the second argument of your `use` call.

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}`);

const equal: CustomMethodImpl<defined> = (_, actual: defined, expected: defined) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use("", ", but it was not").expectedValue(expected);

  return actual === expected ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};
```

## Suffix types

Suffixes are messages that come _after_ the [prefix](#prefix-types), but before the [metadata](#metadata).

### Failure suffix

This is the suffix attached to your messages whenever your check fails.

You can specify a string for this suffix via the `suffix` method.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`)
  .suffix(` because ${place.reason}`)
  .appendPrefix(", but it was not");

// Would be the same as
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value},
but it was not because ${place.reason}`,
);
```

### Negation suffix

The negation suffix is a suffix that _replaces_ the failure suffix, but _only_ when your message is negated.

You can specify a string for this suffix via the `negationSuffix` method.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`)
  .suffix(", but it was not.")
  .negationSuffix(", but it did");

// Would be the same as
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}, but it was not.`,
  `Expected ${place.name} to NOT equal ${place.expected.value}, but it did.`,
);
```

### Trailing failure suffix

The trailing failure suffix is a suffix that is attached to the end of your suffix, but _only_ if the check fails.

Another way to look at it is that it's a suffix attached to the end of your [failure suffix](#failure-suffix), but NOT
your [negation suffix](#negation-suffix).

You can specify a trailing failure suffix with the `trailingFailureSuffix` method.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`)
  .suffix(", but it was not.")
  .negationSuffix(", but it did")
  .trailingFailureSuffix(` because ${place.reason}`);

// Would be the same as
new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}, but it was not because ${place.reason}`,
  `Expected ${place.name} to NOT equal ${place.expected.value}, but it did because ${place.reason}`,
);
```

## Options

You can configure certain output behaviors for your `ExpectMessageBuilder` instances via the
`ExpectMessageBuilderOptions` interface.

```ts
export interface ExpectMessageBuilderOptions {
  trimSpaces: boolean;
  wrapValues: boolean;
  attachFullOnCollapse: boolean;
  trimWhiteSpace: boolean;
}
```

You pass this interface as the third argument to your `ExpectMessageBuilder` constructor call.

```ts
new ExpectMessageBuilder(`Expected ${place.name} to equal ${place.expected.value}`, undefined, {
  trimWhiteSpace: false,
});
```

### Trim spaces

:::info

By default, `trimSpaces` is enabled.

:::

The `trimSpaces` option is for trimming the spaces around placeholders when they're absent.

For example, given the following message:

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.actual.value} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`,
);
```

If the statement was _not_ negated, that means that `${place.not}` would be absent.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="trimSpaces: true" default>

```logstile="Console"
Expected 5 to equal 5
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="trimSpaces: false">

```logstile="Console"
Expected 5 to   equal 5
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Wrap values

:::info

By default, `wrapValues` is enabled.

:::

The `wrapValues` option is for wrapping [VariableData](#variable-data) in quotes when output.

Strings are wrapped in double quotes (`"`), while everything else is wrapped in single quotes (`'`).

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wrapValues: true" default>

```logstile="Console"
Expected '5' to equal "daymon"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wrapValues: false">

```logstile="Console"
Expected 5 to equal daymon
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Attach full on collapse

:::info

By default, `attachFullOnCollapse` is enabled.

:::

The `attachFullOnCollapse` option is for automatically attaching the [full version](#full-value) of variables whenever
they end up collapsed.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="attachFullOnCollapse: true" default>

```logstile="Console"
Expected {...} to equal {...}

Expected (full): '{ name: "Daymon", age: 5 }'
Actual (full): '{ name: "Daymon", age: 6 }'
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="attachFullOnCollapse: false">

```logstile="Console"
Expected {...} to equal {...}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Useful for ensuring your primary failure message is short (and easy to read quickly), while retaining further details
for debugging.

Also allows you to take full advantage of collapsing, without needing to manually attach `place.actual.fullValue` and
`place.expected.fullValue`.

### Trim white space

:::info

By default, `trimWhiteSpace` is enabled.

The `trimWhiteSpace` option is for trimming the white space around the _entire_ message, after it's been full built.

Lets say you appended the path to the start of your messages:

```ts
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `${place.path} Expected ${place.actual.value} to ${place.not} equal ${place.expected.value}`,
);
```

If the statement ended up not having a path, your message would come out with a leading space.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="trimWhiteSpace: false" default>

```logstile="Console"
 Expected 5 to equal 4
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="trimWhiteSpace: true">

```logstile="Console"
Expected 5 to equal 4
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Custom encoding

Sometimes, you need to add variables to your message that are outside the scope of the `actual` and `expected`
variables.

A good example of this is our [deepEquals](/docs/api/expect.assertion.deepequal.md) method.

```logstitle="Console"
Expected '{...}' to deep equal '{...}', but 'cars' was missing some elements

Expected: '["Tesla","Civic"]'
Actual: '["Tesla"]'
Missing: '["Civic"]'

Expected (full): '{"name":"Daymon","cars":["Tesla","Civic"]}'
Actual (full): '{"name":"Daymon","cars":["Tesla"]}'
```

You can use the `encode` method on your `ExpectMessageBuilder` instances to mirror this behavior.

```ts
return message
  .suffix(`, but '${result.path}' was missing some elements`)
  .metadata({
    Actual: message.encode(result.leftValue),
    Expected: message.encode(result.rightValue),
    Missing: message.encode(result.leftMissing),
  })
  .fail();
```

:::tip

There are various parameters you can pass to `encode` for further configuration.

For the sake of keeping this page short, we won't get into them here. If you'd like to learn more about them, take a
look at the [api docs for encode](/docs/api/expect.expectmessagebuilder.encode.md).

## Best practices

- **Keep proxies in mind**: Ensure your output messages are adjusted in a way that is easily consumable when used
  alongside [proxies](/docs/usage-guide#proxies).
- **Provide context**: If your check fails because of a certain key or index, ensure that key or index is included in
  your output. Your message should contain enough metadata so that someone can properly debug the issue without needing
  to rewrite the test just to get further details.
- **Call `use` before populating with values**: It's fine to call methods to add placeholder or static values before
  calling `use`, but failing to call `use` before adding _invocation specific_ data (such as the expected value, or
  index values) will cause your expect message to _leak_ values into subsquent callers.
- **Use nested metadata when using names**: If a path is used, you lose the data associated about your variable when you
  use a `name`. To ensure this data is present, take advantage of [nestedMetadata](#nested-metadata).

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about expect messages:

- They define the **structure** of an error message
- They get **populated** within our custom methods
- They can be used alongside **placeholders** to define drop-in sites for common variables
- They define how a message **changes** when used with _proxies_ or when the check is _negated_
- They can provide **metadata** to follow after the message for _additional context_
