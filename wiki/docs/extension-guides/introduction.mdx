# Introduction

Support for extension libraries was one of the core driving factors behind me writing this library. They provide a way
for you to extend `@rbxts/expect` with your own functionality.

## Overview

:::tip

Check out our [Extension Library Example](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect-example) project to see an end-to-end
example of creating an extension library, and using said extension library.

:::

TestEZ has its own [extend](https://github.com/Roblox/testez/pull/142) method, and jest-lua has its own
[extend](https://jsdotlua.github.io/jest-lua/expect#expectextendmatchers) functionality as well; both of which attempt
to mirror the [jest extenders](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#expectextendmatchers).

The `@rbxts/expect` extend is extremely similiar to both of these, but with a little more nuance- and adjustment to
properly work with typescript module augmentation.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.passMyCustomMethod(6);
```

### Module augmentation

There are two systems that you need to tell about your custom method: typescript, and `@rbxts/expect`.

For typescript to be able to find your custom method, you need to use
[module augmentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation).

You do this on the `Assertion` type in `@rbxts/expect`; which is basically just a wrapper around `expect` calls.

```ts
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    include(expectedValue: InferArrayElement<T>): this;
  }
}
```

This tells typescript "while it might not look like there's an `include` method, belive me there is- and this is what it
looks like".

So typescript will allow you to make calls to `include`, even though there's no actual implementation.

Next, you need to tell `@rbxts/expect` about it, so that your _actual_ implementation can be linked at runtime.

```ts
import { extendMethods } from "@rbxts/expect";

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    include(expectedValue: InferArrayElement<T>): this;
  }
}

extendMethods({
  include: include,
});
```

We'll learn more about the types of extensions you can make in the next couple sections.

### Methods

The most common extension is method extensions; adding your own methods that enforce checks on the "actual" value.

````ts
import { CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods, ExpectMessageBuilder, place } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { includes } from "@rbxts/string-utils";

// define a message for when our check fails
const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} have the substring ${place.expected.value}`,
);

// implement our actual method
const substring: CustomMethodImpl<string> = (_, actual, str: string) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(str);

  return includes(actual, str) ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};

// tell typescript about our method
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    /**
     * Asserts that the string value contains the string `str`.
     *
     * @param str - A string that should be within the value.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * expect("daymon").to.have.the.substring("day");
     * ```
     *
     * @public
     */
    substring(str: string): Assertion<T>;
  }
}

// link our method at runtime
extendMethods({
  substring: substring,
});
````

You can learn more about custom methods through the [custom methods guide](custom-methods).

### Properties

`@rbxts/expect` also allows you to add your own [NOP](custom-properties#nops) and
[negation](custom-properties#negations) properties.

````ts
import { extendNOPs, extendNegations } from "@rbxts/expect";

// tell typescript about our properties
declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    /**
     * Negates the assertion.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * expect(5).to.not.equal(4);
     * ```
     *
     * @public
     */
    readonly not: this;

    /**
     * Negates the assertion.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * expect(5).to.never.equal(4);
     * ```
     *
     * @public
     */
    readonly never: this;

    /**
     * NOOP property for cleaner chaining; does nothing.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * expect([1,2]).to.include(1).and.include(2);
     * ```
     *
     * @public
     */
    readonly and: this;

    /**
     * NOOP property for cleaner chaining; does nothing.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * expect(1).to.be.oneOf([1,2,3]);
     * ```
     *
     * @public
     */
    readonly be: this;
  }
}

// link our negations at runtime
extendNegations(["not", "never"]);

// link our NOPs at runtime
extendNOPs(["and", "be"]);
````

You can learn more about custom properties through the [custom properties guide](custom-properties).

## Using extensions

:::tip

Give the [module augmentation guide](module-augmentation) a read to better understand how this all fits together.

:::

To use a custom extension, you just need to import it somewhere in your build process.

You can see some examples of that in the next couple sections.

### Published extensions

Extensions are _usually_ published with the format `@rbxts/expect-{EXTENSION_NAME}`, so you can find a list of published
libraries by [searching npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40rbxts%2Fexpect).

Once you've installed an extension, to use it you just need to import the package somewhere in your build process.

This could be in your test files

```ts title="src/index.spec.ts"
/// <reference types="@rbxts/testez/globals" />

import { expect } from "@src/index";
// highlight-next-line
import "@rbxts/expect-strings";

export = () => {
  describe("substring", () => {
    it("looks for a string in the string", () => {
      expect("My Name").to.have.the.substring("My");
    });
  });
};
```

In your setup files for your tests

```ts title="src/setup-tests.ts"
// highlight-next-line
import "@rbxts/expect-strings";

export const TEST_PARENT: Person = {
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 5,
  cars: ["Tesla", "Civic"],
  data: {
    id: 1,
  },
};

export const TEST_SON: Person = {
  name: "Kyle",
  age: 4,
  cars: [],
  parent: TEST_PARENT,
};
```

Or even just at the root level of your project

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import "./custom-methods/substring";
```

As long as it gets imported _somewhere_ before (or when) you need it, it'll automatically be added to your `expect`
calls.

:::warning

When installing the library, keep an eye out in your terminal for any warnings.

To use an extension library, you _must_ be using the same major version of `@rbxts/expect` as the library. You should
see a warning from npm if you're not.

:::

### Custom extensions

To use a custom extension you've made in your own project, you need to import the file _somewhere_.

For example, lets say we have the following file:

```ts title="src/custom-methods/substring.ts"
import { CustomMethodImpl, extendMethods, ExpectMessageBuilder, place } from "@rbxts/expect";
import { includes } from "@rbxts/string-utils";

const baseMessage = new ExpectMessageBuilder(
  `Expected ${place.name} to ${place.not} have the substring ${place.expected.value}`,
);

const substring: CustomMethodImpl<string> = (_, actual, str: string) => {
  const message = baseMessage.use().expectedValue(str);

  return includes(actual, str) ? message.pass() : message.fail();
};

declare module "@rbxts/expect" {
  interface Assertion<T> {
    substring(str: string): Assertion<T>;
  }
}

extendMethods({
  substring: substring,
});
```

To _use_ this, we need the `extendMethods` method to actually be called. We can do this by importing the file at some
point during our build process.

One way, is to do it in your tests directly:

```ts title="src/index.spec.ts"
/// <reference types="@rbxts/testez/globals" />

import { expect } from "@src/index";
// highlight-next-line
import "./custom-methods/substring";

export = () => {
  describe("substring", () => {
    it("looks for a string in the string", () => {
      expect("My Name").to.have.the.substring("My");
    });
  });
};
```

Another way is to do it in your root index file:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import "./custom-methods/substring";
```

Or make it a part of your test setup process:

```ts title="src/setup-tests.ts"
// highlight-next-line
import "./custom-methods/substring";

export const TEST_PARENT: Person = {
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 5,
  cars: ["Tesla", "Civic"],
  data: {
    id: 1,
  },
};

export const TEST_SON: Person = {
  name: "Kyle",
  age: 4,
  cars: [],
  parent: TEST_PARENT,
};
```

The point being, that it just needs to be imported _somewhere_ that will be ran before (or when) you need it.

## Publishing extensions

If you want to publish your own extension library for others to use, you should do so with the format
`@rbxts/expect-{EXTENSION_NAME}`, so your library can be easily found by
[searching npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40rbxts%2Fexpect) for `@rbxts/expect` extension libraries.

For guidance on setting up your project properly for publishing, see our [publishing guide](publishing).

You can also check out our [Extension Library Example](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect-example) project to see an
end-to-end example of what this looks like.

## Summary

Let's recap what we've learned about extension libraries:

- They provide a way to **add** your own functionality to `@rbxts/expect`
- They have to be added to the `Assertion` type through **module augmentation**
- They have to be added to `expect` through one of the **extend** methods
- They have to be **linked** at runtime by importing the file
- They are usually **published** under the `@rbxts/expect-{EXTENSION_NAME}` format
