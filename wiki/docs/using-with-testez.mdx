# Using with TestEZ

[TestEZ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/testez) is (currently) the most popular testing framework for roblox
projects.

If you're intending to use `@rbxts/expect` in your TestEZ tests, this page will highlight a few things to be mindful of.

## Using `expect`

Since the intended behavior for TestEZ is to use a global type reference for their types, if you try to use TestEZ with
`@rbxts/expect`, you may find yourself using the `TestEZ` version of `expect` instead of the `expect` from
`@rbxts/expect`.

```ts
/// <reference types="@rbxts/testez/globals" />

export = () => {
  it("works", () => {
    // Property 'deepEqual' does not exist on type 'Expectation<number[]> & CustomMatchers'
    // error-next-line
    expect([1, 2, 3]).to.deepEqual([1, 2, 3]);
  });
};
```

To fix this, you need to explicitly import `expect` from `@rbxts/expect`.

```ts
/// <reference types="@rbxts/testez/globals" />

import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

export = () => {
  it("works", () => {
    expect([1, 2, 3]).to.deepEqual([1, 2, 3]); // works!
  });
};
```

### ESLint

You can use the `no-restricted-globals` rule to catch cases where you accidentally use the wrong `expect`.

```ts
"rules": {
  "no-restricted-globals": [
    "error",
    {
      "name": "expect",
      "message": "Use @rbxts/expect instead."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Migration table

In migrating from the [TestEZ expect](https://roblox.github.io/testez/api-reference/#expect) to the
[`@rbxts/expect` expect](api/expect.expect), you might find yourself using the wrong method or property.

You can use the table below to map from `TestEZ` to `@rbxts/expect`.

<TestEZTable />

Anything that isn't in the table is the same across both.
