### Why should I use this over `@rbxts/jest` or `@rbxts/testez`? {#why-should-i-use-this}

`expect` doesn't replace either of these libraries; it only provides the assertions. If you're asking why you should use
`expect` over the existing assertions provided in either, then I'll get more into that below.

The matchers provided by `@rbxts/jest` can only be used within a jest test block; otherwise it'll throw an error.
Furthermore, `@rbxts/jest` aligns more with the assertion matcher style of `toBe` versus the chai style of `to.be`.

The matchers provided by `@rbxts/testez` _also_ can't be used outside of a test. It's also fairly difficult to add
custom matchers; as they're declared on a global namespace. Not to mention, the lack of documentation on extensions
anyhow.

But most importantly, I wasn't satisified with the error messages provided by either library. I wanted more descriptive
error messages, with more native support for nested table property testing.

In conclusion, `@rbxts/expect` provides the following benefits over `@rbxts/jest` and `@rbxts/testez`:

- Easier extensionality, with in-depth documentation
- Can be used outside of tests
- More descriptive error messages
- Better support for testing tables

### Where's the support for XYZ?

If you're looking for a certain method, make sure to check the open
[github issues](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/issues). There may be a pending issue for adding your method.

If not, feel free to [make one](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/issues/new)! I'm always open to adding more
matchers and features.

### Why are `a` and `an` NOPs?

If you're coming from `@rbxts/testez`, you may notice that `a` and `an` are no longer matchers that check the type of an
actual value.

This was an intentional design decision. I personally believe that `a` and `an` serve a much better purpose as NOP
properties (for readability sake) than they do as type matchers.

This allows us to write things like this:

```ts
expect([1, 2, 3]).to.be.an.array();
expect("Daymon").to.have.a.lengthOf(6);
```

### Why not adapt `chai`?

While `@rbxts/expect` takes a lot of inspiration from [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), it doesn't include support for
certain features like "chainable methods".

For example, you can't do stuff like this in `@rbxts/expect`:

```ts
expect(5).to.be.a.negative.number();
expect(person).to.have.age.above(18);
```

Instead, you need to do stuff like this:

```ts
expect(5).to.be.negative();
expect(person).to.have.a.property("age").that.is.above(18);
```

This is something I _would_ be interested in doing, and I probably will in the future. The problem is that in-order to
make this work for roblox (where we don't have object prototypes), we'd need to take advantage of metatables. That isn't
a huge problem by itself, but when you take into account all the "black magic" that goes on behind the scenes to make
"chainable methods" work (especially when used alongside "flags")- it becomes very error-prone. If the implementation
isn't done _just_ right, you can end up with an assertion library that doesn't work properly.

To avoid this, I decided to not adapt excessive property flags, or chainable methods. Currently, my main priority is
getting an assertion library out that fits the requirements I established [in the first point](#why-should-i-use-this)-
so that I can use it in other projects I'm currently working on.

I may revisit this in the future, and provide an assertion library more akin to chai. But for now, I'm fine living
without the above features.

### Can I use this for client-side testing too?

Of course! Check out the [client usage](usage-guide#client-usage) section of the usage guide.

### There seems to be a bug/typo in a certain check?

Oops! Please [create an issue](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect/issues/new) on the repo, and I'll make sure to fix
that ❤️
