# Objects

## API

### Is an Object

You can use the [object](/docs/api/expect.assertion.object.md) method to check if a provided value is actually an
object.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect({ name: "Daymon" }).to.be.an.object();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '5' to be of type 'table', but it was a 'number'
```

### Empty

You can use the [empty](/docs/api/expect.assertion.empty.md) method to check if an object contains any keys.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect({}).to.be.empty();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected the object to be empty, but it had had the key 'name'

Value of [name]: "Daymon"
```

### Length

You can use the [length](/docs/api/expect.assertion.length.md) method to check if an object has a certain amount of
keys.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect({
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 24,
}).to.have.a.lengthOf(2);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected the object to have exactly '3' key(s), but it actually had '2'

Value: '{"name":"Daymon","age":24}'
```

### Deep equal

You can use the [deepEqual](/docs/api/expect.assertion.deepequal.md) method to check if two objects are _deeply_ equal
to one another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect({
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 5,
}).to.deepEqual({
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 5,
});
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '{...}' to deep equal '{...}', but 'age' has a different value

Expected: '4' (number)
Actual: '5' (number)

Expected (full): '{"name":"Daymon","age":4}'
Actual (full): '{"name":"Daymon","age":5}'
```

### Match

You can use the [match](/docs/api/expect.assertion.match.md) method to check if an object has a collection of certain
keys with certain values.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect({
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 5,
}).to.match({
  age: 5,
});
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '{...}' to match '{...}', but 'age' has a different value

Expected: '4' (number)
Actual: '5' (number)

Expected (full): '{"age":4}'
Actual (full): '{"name":"Daymon","age":5}'
```

### Key/Property

You can use the [key](/docs/api/expect.assertion.key.md) or [property](/docs/api/expect.assertion.property.md) methods
to check if an object has a certina key.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect({
  name: "Daymon",
  age: 5,
}).to.have.the.key("name");
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '{...}' to have the key "parent", but it was missing

Actual (full): '{"name":"Daymon","age":5}'
```

## Extra

[Proxies](/docs/usage-guide#proxies) allow you to provide the path of nested variables in your test output.
