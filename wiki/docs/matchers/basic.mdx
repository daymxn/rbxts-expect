# Basic

This page contains matchers that apply to _all_ types.

## API

### Any of

You can use the [anyOf](/docs/api/expect.assertion.anyof.md) method to check if a provided value is shallowly equal to
one of the values in an array.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(1).to.be.anyOf([1, 2, 3]);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '5' (number) to be any of '[1,2,3,4]'
```

### Equal

You can use the [equals](/docs/api/expect.assertion.equals.md) method to check if a provided value is strictly equal to
another value.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(1).to.equal(1);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '5' (number) to strictly equal "5" (string)
```

### Instance of

You can use the [instanceOf](/docs/api/expect.assertion.instanceof.md) method to check if a provided value is of a
certain type.

This includes support for checkable types, [t checks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/t), and even user-defined
callbacks.

```ts
import { expect, TypeCheckCallback } from "@rbxts/expect";
import t from "@rbxts/t";

const isNumber: TypeCheckCallback = (value) => {
  return typeOf(value) === "number";
};

expect(1).to.be.an.instanceOf("number");
expect(1).to.be.an.instanceOf(t.number);
expect(1).to.be.an.instanceOf(isNumber);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '5' to be of type 'string', but it was a 'number'
```

### Satisfy

You can use the [satisfy](/docs/api/expect.assertion.satisfy.md) method to check if a provided value passes a given
callback.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(4).to.satisfy((value) => 4 % 2 === 0);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '5' (number) to satisfy a given callback, but it didn't
```

### Defined

You can use the [defined](/docs/api/expect.assertion.defined.md) method to check if a provided value is not null.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(1).to.be.defined();
expect(1).to.be.ok();
expect(1).to.exist();

expect(undefined).to.not.be.defined();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected the value to be defined, but it was undefined
```

### Undefined

You can use the [undefined](/docs/api/expect.assertion.undefined.md) method to check if a provided value is null.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(undefined).to.be.undefined();
expect(undefined).to.be.null();
expect(undefined).to.be.nil();

expect(5).to.not.be.undefined();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '5' (number) to be undefined, but it was defined
```
