# Strings

## API

### Substring

You can use the [substring](/docs/api/expect.assertion.substring.md) method to check if a string contains another
string.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect("my name").to.have.the.substring("my");
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected "your name" to have the substring "my"
```

### Pattern

You can use the [pattern](/docs/api/expect.assertion.pattern.md) method to check if a string contains a match for a
[roblox string pattern](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/strings#string-pattern-reference).

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect("Hello World").to.have.the.pattern("%u%l");
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected "hello world" to have a match for the pattern /%u%l/, but it was missing
```

### Empty

You can use the [empty](/docs/api/expect.assertion.empty.md) method to check if a string has any characters.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect("").to.be.empty();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected "daymon" to be empty, but it was not
```

### Size

You can use the [size](/docs/api/expect.assertion.size.md) method to check if a string has a certain amount of
characters.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect("daymon").to.have.a.sizeOf(6);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected "12345" to have a size of exactly '6', but it actually had a size of '5'
```

### Starts with

You can use the [startsWith](/docs/api/expect.assertion.startwith_1.md) method to check if a string starts with another
string.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect("daymon").to.startWith("day");
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected "day" to be a string that starts with "bry", but it was missing
```

### Ends with

You can use the [endsWith](/docs/api/expect.assertion.endwith_1.md) method to check if a string ends with another
string.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect("daymon").to.endWith("mon");
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected "daymon" to be a string that ends with "yan", but it was missing
```
