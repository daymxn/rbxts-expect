# Numbers

## API

### Greater than

You can use the [greaterThan](/docs/api/expect.assertion.greaterthan.md) method to check if a number is greater than
another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(10).to.be.greaterThan(5);
expect(10).to.be.gt(5);
expect(10).to.be.above(5);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '1' to be greater than '2'
```

### Greater than or equal to

You can use the [greaterThanOrEqualTo](/docs/api/expect.assertion.greaterthanorequalto.md) method to check if a number
is greater than or equal to another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(10).to.be.greaterThanOrEqualTo(10);
expect(10).to.be.gte(5);
expect(10).to.be.at.least(5);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '1' to be greater than or equal to '2'
```

### Less than

You can use the [lessThan](/docs/api/expect.assertion.lessthan.md) method to check if a number is less than another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.lessThan(10);
expect(5).to.be.lt(10);
expect(5).to.be.below(10);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '2' to be less than '1'
```

### Less than or equal to

You can use the [lessThanOrEqualTo](/docs/api/expect.assertion.lessthanorequalto.md) method to check if a number is less
than or equal to another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.lessThanOrEqualTo(5);
expect(5).to.be.lte(10);
expect(5).to.be.at.most(10);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '2' to be less than or equal to '1'
```

### Negative

You can use the [negative](/docs/api/expect.assertion.negative.md) method to check if a number is less than zero.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(-5).to.be.negative();

expect(0).to.not.be.negative();
expect(5).to.not.be.negative();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '1' to be a negative number, but it was positive
```

### Positive

You can use the [positive](/docs/api/expect.assertion.positive.md) method to check if a number is greater than zero.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.positive();

expect(0).to.not.be.positive();
expect(-5).to.not.be.positive();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '-1' to be a positive number, but it was negative
```

### Even

You can use the [even](/docs/api/expect.assertion.even.md) method to check if a number is even.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(2).to.be.even();
expect(4).to.be.even();
expect(-20).to.be.even();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '3' to be even, but it was odd.
```

### Odd

You can use the [odd](/docs/api/expect.assertion.odd.md) method to check if a number is odd.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(1).to.be.odd();
expect(3).to.be.odd();
expect(-11).to.be.odd();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '2' to be odd, but it was even.
```

### Between

You can use the [between](/docs/api/expect.assertion.between.md) or [within](/docs/api/expect.assertion.within.md)
methods to check if a number is within a specified range (inclusively).

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.within(1, 10);
expect(0).to.be.between(0, 100);
expect(-10).to.be.within(-20, 20);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '10' to be a number between 5 and 8, but it was too high.
```

### Finite

You can use the [finite](/docs/api/expect.assertion.finite.md) method to check if a number is within `+-math.huge`

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.finite();
expect(-5).to.be.finite();

expect("5").to.not.be.finite();
expect(math.huge).to.not.be.finite();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected 'inf' to be a finite number, but it was 'math.huge'
```

### Near

You can use the [near](/docs/api/expect.assertion.near.md) or [closeTo](/docs/api/expect.assertion.closeto.md) methods
to check if a number is within a margin of another.

When a margin isn't specified, epsilon is used instead (per
[IEEE 754 float64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)).

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.near(5 + 1e-8);
expect(1.5).to.be.near(1, 0.5);
expect(math.pi).to.be.near(3, 0.2);
expect(-10).to.be.closeTo(0, 15);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '1' to be a number close to '0', but it was too high
```
