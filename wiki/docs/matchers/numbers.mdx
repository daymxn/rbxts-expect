# Numbers

## API

### Greater than

You can use the [greaterThan](/docs/api/expect.assertion.greaterthan.md) method to check if a number is greater than
another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(10).to.be.greaterThan(5);
expect(10).to.be.gt(5);
expect(10).to.be.above(5);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '1' to be greater than '2'
```

### Greater than or equal to

You can use the [greaterThanOrEqualTo](/docs/api/expect.assertion.greaterthanorequalto.md) method to check if a number
is greater than or equal to another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(10).to.be.greaterThanOrEqualTo(10);
expect(10).to.be.gte(5);
expect(10).to.be.at.least(5);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '1' to be greater than or equal to '2'
```

### Less than

You can use the [lessThan](/docs/api/expect.assertion.lessthan.md) method to check if a number is less than another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.lessThan(10);
expect(5).to.be.lt(10);
expect(5).to.be.below(10);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '2' to be less than '1'
```

### Less than or equal to

You can use the [lessThanOrEqualTo](/docs/api/expect.assertion.lessthanorequalto.md) method to check if a number is less
than or equal to another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(5).to.be.lessThanOrEqualTo(5);
expect(5).to.be.lte(10);
expect(5).to.be.at.most(10);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '2' to be less than or equal to '1'
```

### Even

You can use the [even](/docs/api/expect.assertion.even.md) method to check if a number is even.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(2).to.be.even();
expect(4).to.be.even();
expect(-20).to.be.even();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '3' to be even, but it was odd.
```

### Odd

You can use the [odd](/docs/api/expect.assertion.odd.md) method to check if a number is odd.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect(1).to.be.odd();
expect(3).to.be.odd();
expect(-11).to.be.odd();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '2' to be odd, but it was even.
```
