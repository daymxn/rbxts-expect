# Arrays

An array is classified as a table of incrementing number keys that start at `1`, and without any holes.

In typescript, the distinction between an `object` and an `array` is pretty black and white, while in lua, this
distinction is usually lost.

`@rbxts/expect` attempts to rectify this by providing helper methods for checking arrays.

## API

### Is an Array

You can use the [array](/docs/api/expect.assertion.array.md) method to check if a provided value is actually an array.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.be.an.array();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '{"name": "Daymon"}' to be an array, but it had a non number key 'name' (string)
```

### Array type

You can use an overload on the [array](/docs/api/expect.assertion.array.md) method to check if an array contains
elements all of a certain type.

This includes support for checkable types, [t checks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/t), and even user-defined
callbacks.

```ts
import { expect, TypeCheckCallback } from "@rbxts/expect";
import t from "@rbxts/t";

const isNumber: TypeCheckCallback = (value) => {
  return typeOf(value) === "number";
};

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.be.an.arrayOf("number");
expect([1, 2, 3]).to.be.an.arrayOf(t.number);
expect([1, 2, 3]).to.be.an.arrayOf(isNumber);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2,3]' to be an array of type 'string', but there was an element that was a 'number'

Index: 1
Value: 1
```

### Includes

You can use the [includes](/docs/api/expect.assertion.includes.md) method to check if a value is present in the array.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.include(4);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2,3]' to include '4', but it was missing
```

### Empty

You can use the [empty](/docs/api/expect.assertion.empty.md) method to check if an array contains any elements.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([]).to.be.empty();
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2,3]' to be empty, but it had 3 elements
```

### Length

You can use the [length](/docs/api/expect.assertion.length.md) method to check if an array has a certain amount of
elements.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.have.a.lengthOf(3);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2]' to have exactly '3' element(s), but it actually had '2'
```

### Deep equal

You can use the [deepEqual](/docs/api/expect.assertion.deepequal.md) method to check if two arrays are _deeply_ equal to
one another.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.deepEqual([1, 2, 3]);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2]' to deep equal '[1]', but there were extra elements

Expected: '[1]'
Actual: '[1,2]'
Extra Elements: '[2]'
```

### Starts with

You can use the [startsWith](/docs/api/expect.assertion.startWith.md) method to check if an array starts with another
array.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.startWith([1, 2]);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2,3]' to be an array that starts with '[1,4,5]', but it was missing 2 elements

Missing: '[4,5]'
```

### Ends with

You can use the [endsWith](/docs/api/expect.assertion.endWith.md) method to check if an array ends with another array.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.endWith([2, 3]);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2,3,4]' to be an array that ends with '[1,2,4]', but it was missing 2 elements

Missing: '[1,2]'
```

### Some

You can use the [some](/docs/api/expect.assertion.some.md) method to check if an array passes some condition.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.have.some((it) => it % 2 === 0);
expect(["Daymon", "Bryan"]).to.have.some(`starts with "Bry"`, (it) => startsWith(it, "Bry"));
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '["Byron", "Bryan"]' to have atleast one element that starts with "Day"
```

### Contain exactly

You can use the [containsExactly](/docs/api/expect.assertion.containexactly.md) method to check if an array **deeply**
contains all of the elements in another array, with no regard for order and without any extra elements.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.containExactly([3, 2, 1]);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2]' to contain exactly '[1,2,3]', but it was missing elements

Missing elements: '[3]'
```

### Contain exactly in order

You can use the [containsExactlyInOrder](/docs/api/expect.assertion.containexactlyinorder.md) method to check if an
array **deeply** contains all of the elements in another array, without any extra elements and in the same order.

```ts
import { expect } from "@rbxts/expect";

expect([1, 2, 3]).to.containsExactlyInOrder([1, 2, 3]);
```

#### Example error

```logs
Expected '[1,2,3]' to contain exactly '[1,3,2]', but it had a different value for the element at '[1]'

Expected [1]: '3'
Actual [1]: '2'
```
